## Statement of work

It is **2.0** version of my very first project when I started to learn frontend.

My goal in 1.0 version was to try to make my first **HTML layout**, but now when I already have significant commercial experience in development, i decided to migrate my project to **Vue.js**, **TypeScript** and **SASS**.

---

## Results

Successfully implemented **Vue.js** with **Vue-router**, **TypeScript** for a strict types and **SASS** for styling.

Beside base technologies in 2.0 version I used:
– **Firebase** to store projects data
– **Cloudinary** to store images
– some components from **Vuetify UI library**
– script to prettify text
– **FancyBox** as library for fullscreen images view
– unit-testing with **Jest**  and **Vue Test Utils**
– **GitHub CI** for automated deployment to **GitHub Pages**
